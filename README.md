# Class project

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to build a class and use its properties and methods by creating objects.

### Problem

Build employees class, with the mentioned properties and methods below.

### Implementation
<br/>

- In the `Employee` class:

1. Add the properties below to the Employee class:  
**int id**  
**string name**  
**string role**  
**double salary**  

2. Create `printInfo()` method, that prints all Employee class properties.
<br/>
   
- In the `main` function:
3. Create an object of the Employee class

4. Access object properties and assign value for each one

5. Call `printInfo()` method to print object values
For example, when running the program the output should be similar to the below:
  
  
```
ID: 1
Name: Ahmed
Role: Software developer
Salary: 10000

```
<br/>
<br/>
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Employee {

    public:
    /* Add your code here 
    1
    */


   /* Add your code here 
    2
    */


};

int main(){

    /* Add your code here 
    3
    */

   /* Add your code here 
    4
    */

   /* Add your code here 
    5
    */



return 0;

};

```
