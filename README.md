# Class project

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to build class and use it's properities and methods by creating objects.

### Problem

Build employees class with the mentioned properities and methods below:

### Implementation

- In `Employee` class:

1. Add the properities below to the employee class:  
int id
string name
string role
double salary

2. Add the method below to the employee class:
printInfo(){}  
This method should prrint all employee class properities.


- In `Employee` class:
3. Create object of Employee class

4. Access object properities and assighn value for each one

5. Call printInfo(){} method to print object values
Example, when the running the program the output should be similar to the below:


```
ID: 1
Name: Ahmed
Role: Software developer
Salary: 10000

```
  
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Employee {

    public:
    /* Add your code here 
    1. Propereties id, name, roel, salary
    */


   /* Add your code here 
    2. Methods printInfo(){}
    */


};

int main(){

    /* Add your code here 
    3. Create object of Employee class
    */

   /* Add your code here 
    4. Access object properities and assighn value for each one
    */

   /* Add your code here 
    5. Call printInfo(){} method to print object values
    */
